## Signal Processing-adjacent Notebooks!

As learning exercises for Signal Processing, I worked on the following notebooks:  
[Music Genre Identification](https://github.com/aith/NN_music_genre_identification)  
[Sonification of non-audio Data](https://github.com/aith/water-level-sonification)  
[Audio Feature Extraction](https://github.com/aith/audio-feature-extractions/blob/main/index.ipynb)  
[Audio Analysis Paradigms](https://github.com/aith/audio-analysis-representations)  
  
I then attempted to combine my knowledge in Signal Processing with Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning by creating an automatic speech recognition model- I was unable to get it working, but you'll find the notebook to be educational!
