I'm newly a Bachelor of Computer Science (specializing in Computer Game Applications) from University of California, Santa Cruz!  

My main interest is creating and researching [generators](https://galaxykate0.tumblr.com/post/139774965871/so-you-want-to-build-a-generator) that improve the our lives. By extension, my work explores generative algorithms and AI.  

I want to contribute to:
+ Solving human health
+ Creating media that could not be done by humans alone

Let's make the world a better place!
