As of 2021, I'm a University of California, Santa Cruz B.S. of Computer Science: Computer Game Design!  

My main interest is creating and researching [generators](https://galaxykate0.tumblr.com/post/139774965871/so-you-want-to-build-a-generator) that improve the our lives. By extension, my work explores generative algorithms and AI.  

I want to contribute to:
+ Solving human health
+ Creating things that could not be done by humans alone

Let's make the world a better place!
